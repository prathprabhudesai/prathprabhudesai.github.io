<p align=justify>I have been playing indian classical Harmonium since 13 years. I am a disciple of Mr. Rajesh Puranik and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsidas_Borkar">Pt. Tulsidas Borkar</a>. I have accompanied many classical singers and tabla players.</p> 
<p align=justify>I was an active part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifbhfWi1XFQ" >PICT Art Circle</a>. I represented PICT as a musician and as a music arranger and designer in prestegious Purushottam Karandak and Firodiya Karandak. I was the <i>Inter College Cultural Representative</i> for the year 2012. Currently, I am a member of <strong>301 Productions</strong>, a group formed by ex-PICTians which sponsors one act plays of PICT for their professional shows.</p>
