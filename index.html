    <td><p> <strong>Stattistical Modelling of Fish Population</strong>
<p> Random Processes Course Project, North Carolina State University</p>
<p>Echo SONAR is used for the determination of fish population which used sinusoidal sound pulses with rayleigh distributed amplitudes. The school of fish was found to be normally distributed (gaussian) verifying the Central Limit Theorem. The process was modelled using fish's position, orientation and motion as random variables.</p></td>

 <td><p> <strong>Velocity Profiler</strong>
<p> Senior Year Thesis, Pune Institute of Computer Technology and CW&PRS</p>
<p>System aims at open-stream water velocity profiling using Digital Image Processing algorithms (influcned by motion tracking and Particle Image Velocimetry). Ths research was carried out on Bombay Port Model, CWPRS for the Navi Mumbai International Airpot safety issues. Then existing hardware technologies mainly included Vertical Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) sensors which are costly and fail to acheive directional profiling. This non-contact technology provided a low cost and accurate solution overcoming the existing drawbacks.</p></td>
<td><p> <strong>Sediment Deposition Analysis: Categorization and Quantization, Bed Profiling and Dispersion Analysis</strong>
<p> Research Projects,Central Water and Power Research Station</p>
<p>The research work was carried out on the sediment depositories in the coastal hydraulic model with an aim of identifying the reservoir storage capacity, advanced planning for water management and strengthening silt removal process. A new algorithm based on gamma correction was developed for the accurate detection of sediments and neural network techniques were used for the classification. Analysis of topographic nature of the water channel was also done using bed profiling with the help of sensor mapping and contour plotting. The dispersion coefficients were calculated for the analysis of behavior of foreign fluids in water.

<td><p> <strong>Vehicular Database Management System for Accident Avoidance</strong>
<p>Project dealt with the innovative methodology to avoid accidents mainly occurred due to over-speeding. A microcontroller based speed monitoring system was developed for a vehicle (local station) which would compare the instantaneous speed with the location based spped limit. The decsion authority (Stopping the vehicle, logging, license cancellation) and control station were equipped with NI LabVIEW. Communication between local stations and a central control station was established through a GSM link. Project was finalist in NIYANTRA-2012, an autonomous embedded system design contest organized by National Instruments.</p></td>
<td><p> <strong>Camera Aided Topography Measurement System</strong>
<p> Junior Year, Pune Institute of Computer Technology</p>
<p>The project was an implementation and modification of an IEEE paper "Distance and Angle Measurement of Objects on an Oblique Plane Based on Pixel Number Variation of CCD Images”. It dealt with the topographic analysis of the surrounding using various trigonometric distance measurement methods and PNV.</p></td>
